## Why this Track

Track-1 establishes a unified, practitioner-oriented view of **Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)** for large P&C carriers, balancing **catastrophe modeling** (Touchstone / Touchstone Re and peers) with **actuarial pricing**, **capital adequacy**, and **risk transfer** practices.  
We aim for **reproducible analyses**, transparent assumptions, and decision-grade exhibits you can reuse in committee packs and model governance memos.


---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Track-1, participants will be able to:

1. **Frame ERM for a cat-exposed P&C portfolio**  
   - Set risk context, identify accumulations, and define measurable risk appetite.

2. **Operationalize catastrophe models** for decision support  
   - Produce and interpret **AAL**, **OEP/AEP EP curves**, **PML**, **TVaR** (gross → net), and articulate key modeling assumptions and sensitivities.

3. **Link modeling outputs to capital and reinsurance**  
   - Translate tails to **capital sufficiency**; design/compare **quota share** and **XoL** towers; quantify **ROL**, **net AAL**, and **tail reduction**.

4. **Embed underwriting & pricing discipline**  
   - Combine cat loss costs with actuarial models (GLM/GBM) and implement guardrails (elevation, roof, surge proximity, code compliance).

5. **Design portfolio-level mitigations and diversification**  
   - Evaluate mitigation credits, code impacts, and cross-segment diversification for volatility and capital efficiency gains.

6. **Build durable ERM governance**  
   - Institute quarterly ERM packs, model change logs, controls, and event-response playbooks; document validation and versioning.

7. **Drive an innovation backlog**  
   - Prioritize climate deltas, non-stationarity, ML property attributes, and near-real-time event analytics with clear pilot KPIs.

## What You’ll Produce (Track Deliverables)

- **Case Exhibits**: EP curves, AAL bridges (gross → net), tail tables, retention/layer trade studies.
- **Reinsurance Trade Study**: Options vs. **ROL / net AAL / TVaR / capital relief** with recommendation.
- **Risk Appetite Statement**: Measurable limits/targets aligned to capital and liquidity.
- **Governance Artifacts**: Model change log, quarterly ERM pack checklist, event-response runbook.
- **Capstone Case Study**: Florida single-family homeowners, wind & flood; premium = **$1B**.

---

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with cat modeling concepts (perils, exposure attributes, vulnerability, demand surge).
- Working knowledge of actuarial pricing basics (GLM/relativities) and reinsurance structures (QS, XoL).
- Access to modeling and analytics tools listed below.

---

## Tooling & Data

- **Cat Platforms**: Touchstone / Touchstone Re (primary), RMS (peer review), JBA/KatRisk (flood detail), Hazus (public baseline).  
- **Data**: Policy admin, geocodes, FEMA FIRM, NOAA SLR, LiDAR DEM, parcel/roof attributes where available.  
- **Analytics**: Python/R for analysis and plotting; QGIS/ArcGIS for hazard mapping; Quarto for reproducible publishing.

## Assessment & Exercises

- **Hands-on labs**: Run EP curves, build AAL bridges, and compare RI towers.  
- **Short memos**: 1–2 page decision briefs (risk appetite, RI recommendation).  
- **Peer reviews**: Cross-check assumptions, inputs, and reproducibility for a selected exhibit.

---

## Governance & Reproducibility

- **Versioning**: Record model version, options, exposure snapshot date, vulnerability set, stochastic seed.  
- **Change Log**: Capture deltas and expected impact; attach pre/post exhibits.  
- **Controls**: Two-person review for all capstone figures; retain CSVs and parameter files.  
- **Publish**: Commit `.qmd` + assets; render HTML/PDF with date-stamped footers.

## Notes to Contributors

- Keep exhibits reproducible: include inputs, seeds, and model options.  
- Use consistent figure/table captions and units.  
- Add a short “Decision Relevance” paragraph under each exhibit.
