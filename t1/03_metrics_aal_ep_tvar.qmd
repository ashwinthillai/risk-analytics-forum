title: "AAL, EP Curves, and Tail Metrics in Practice"
---

- Interpret **AAL**, **OEP/AEP**, **PML**, **TVaR**, **ROL**.
- Views: **Gross**, **Net of RI**, **Net of reinstatements** by geography/attributes.
- Example thresholds: AAL ≤ 12–15% of premium; capital+RI ≥ 120–150% of **AEP 1-in-100**.
- Exhibits: EP curve plots; Gross→Net AAL bridges; tail tables.
