title: "Exposure Analysis & Hazard Mapping"
---

**Objectives.** Build exposure inventory (TIV, construction, year built, mitigation), map **wind/surge/flood** hazards, and quantify accumulations.

**Data & Tools.** Policy admin, geocoding, FEMA FIRM/NOAA SLR/LiDAR DEM; QGIS/ArcGIS; parcel attributes.

**Workflow.**
1. Data QC & geocoding checks
2. Zonal aggregations (county/ZIP/grid)
3. Accumulations & thresholds (e.g., %TIV within 2km coast)
4. Mitigation inventory (roof, shutters, FBC compliance)

**Outputs.** TIV choropleths, surge/flood overlays, accumulation tables.
